            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>This was created to help people quickly look up info for their 2E games - if you have some fun with it that's great! I wrote a similar one for playtest for my local group. This time I ported to web and mobile & figured I'd let others know about it.</p>
            <p>The full code is available on GitHub - <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/fyjham-ts/Pathfinder-2E-Spell-DB">https://github.com/fyjham-ts/Pathfinder-2E-Spell-DB</a> - I'd love to hear your input. If you hit any bugs or want to request a feature, raise a GitHub issue!</p>
            <p>I'm a big fan of Paizo and I respect their hard work making my favourite hobby more fun. I've done this all in good faith, and will take down at a simple request from anyone from Paizo (Whether I've breached any license or not - if this bothers them I don't want to do it).</p>

            <p>Code written by Tim Schneider</p>
            <p>OGL & Community Use content from Paizo HEAVILY used.</p>
            <p>Data gathered as a mix of scraping from <a href="https://www.aonprd.com">Archives of Nethys</a> and mind-numbing data entry. I wouldn't have been able to do this if I had to enter it all from scratch. They did the hard legwork.</p>
